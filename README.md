# brainwaves-client

React client app for [brainwaves-api](https://www.github.com/MathieuDebit/brainwaves-api).

## Getting started

> You will need [NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for Javascript dependencies, and the [Middleman framework](https://middlemanapp.com) to run the source code.
Make sure to install and configure everything first.

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:MathieuDebit/brainwaves-client.git
cd brainwaves-client
bundle install
npm install
```

Set up environment variables in a `.env` file

```
API_DOMAIN=
```

That's it! Everyting you have to know about how to work with a Middleman project is in the official documentation: [https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/install/).

- Start the server by running the following command, then visit [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/).

```
middleman
```

- To have the static app, build sources:

```
middleman build
```
